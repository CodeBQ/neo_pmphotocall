      "How I approach exposure when the scene is mostly shadows, neon, and mixed light sources.",
    preview: `For night streets I usually start at ISO 1600, f/2, and a shutter speed I can hand-hold
without losing too much sharpness. From there, I look for the brightest element in the frame —
usually a sign or shop window — and decide whether I want that blown out or just at the edge
of clipping. I meter for that, then let the shadows fall where they want.

The important part is staying consistent: I choose one exposure strategy per scene,
so the series feels cohesive when viewed as a whole.`,
